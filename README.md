# JetsonRocksSeashells
AI to detect and classify rocks and seashells for the Jetson AI Specialist Certificate, sought during the MAE/ECE 148 class at UCSD.

The scripts in this Jetson Inference-based repository detect and classify rocks and sea shells. More developed and advanced AI tools like this one could be used to differentiate between rocks and shells in marine environments, either for use in aquaculture (i.e. harvesting mussels and clams), or to identify otherwise well-camoflauged invertebrates underwater for conservation purposes.
